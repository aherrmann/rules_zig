# Bazel build rules for Zig

Build [Zig code][zig] with the [Bazel build system][bazel].

[zig]: https://ziglang.org/
[bazel]: https://bazel.build/

## Status

Take a look at the [planned functionality][planned-functionality] tracking
issue to get a picture of which functionality is already implemented and what
is still missing.

[planned-functionality]: https://github.com/aherrmann/rules_zig/issues/1

## Motivation

Why would you use Bazel to build Zig code,
when Zig comes with its own perfectly fine [build system][zig-build]?

These Bazel rules are not meant as competition to the Zig build system.
If your project fits well within the scope of Zig's build system,
in particular, it only uses Zig code and perhaps C/C++ code,
then Zig's build system will probably work very well for your use-case.

Bazel is useful for polyglot, monorepo projects,
especially if they are very large.
If your project involves multiple programming languages
and if some of them are not supported by Zig's build system,
or if your project involves complex code-generation steps
or requires a lot of [custom build steps][zig-build-command-step],
then Bazel may be a good choice.
If your project is already a Bazel project
and you want to add Zig code to it
then this rule set is for you.

Bazel has builtin support for [cross-compilation][bazel-platforms]
and [build configuration][bazel-configurations],
meaning it can support Zig's cross-compilation
and build configuration features well.

## Installation

The instructions assume basic familiarity with the Bazel build system.
Take a look at [Bazel's documentation][bazel-intro] if you are unfamiliar.

Consider the [_Additional Setup_](#additional-setup) section as well.

### Using Bzlmod with Bazel >=7

Bzlmod is Bazel's new dependency manager. You can read more about it in the
[Bazel documentation][bzlmod-doc]. If you use bzlmod, then you can skip the
WORKSPACE section below. Take a look at [Bazel's migration
guide][bzlmod-migration] if you are switching from WORKSPACE to bzlmod.

[bzlmod-doc]: https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod
[bzlmod-migration]: https://bazel.build/external/migration

To install a [release version of rules_zig][rules-zig-releases] follow the
installation instructions given in the corresponding release notes.

[rules-zig-releases]: https://github.com/aherrmann/rules_zig/releases

To install a development version add the following to your MODULE.bazel file:

```bzl
bazel_dep(name = "rules_zig")
archive_override(
    module_name = "rules_zig",
    integrity = "sha256-$SHA256",
    strip_prefix = "rules_zig-$COMMIT",
    urls = ["https://github.com/aherrmann/rules_zig/archive/$COMMIT.tar.gz"],
)
```

Note, `$SHA256` and `$COMMIT` are placeholders that you need to fill in. Take a
look at the [Bazel documentation][archive-override-doc] for further
information.

[archive-override-doc]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/rules/lib/globals/module#archive_override

### Using WORKSPACE

The old way of managing external dependencies with Bazel is to declare them in
your WORKSPACE file. You can read more about it in the [Bazel
documentation][workspace-doc]. If you use the WORKSPACE approach, then you can
skip the bzlmod section above.

[workspace-doc]: https://bazel.build/external/overview#workspace-system

To install a [release version of rules_zig][rules-zig-releases] follow the
installation instructions given in the corresponding release notes.

To install a development version add the following to your WORKSPACE file:

```bzl
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "rules_zig",
    sha256 = "$SHA256",
    strip_prefix = "rules_zig-$COMMIT",
    urls = ["https://github.com/aherrmann/rules_zig/archive/$COMMIT.tar.gz"],
)

load(
    "@rules_zig//zig:repositories.bzl",
    "rules_zig_dependencies",
    "zig_register_toolchains",
)

rules_zig_dependencies()

zig_register_toolchains(
    name = "zig",
    zig_version = "0.14.1",
)
```

Note, `$SHA256` and `$COMMIT` are placeholders that you need to fill in. Take a
look at the [Bazel documentation][http-archive-doc] for further
information.

### Additional Setup

#### Zig Cache

The Zig compiler caches intermediate outputs on disk. This cache is shared and
persisted between Bazel builds and build actions. You can configure the cache
directory using the following set of environment variables, you can configure
them through Bazel by using the `--repo_env` flag.

- `RULES_ZIG_CACHE_PREFIX_LINUX`: Cache directory on Linux, default `/tmp/zig-cache`.
- `RULES_ZIG_CACHE_PREFIX_MACOS`: Cache directory on MacOS, default `/var/tmp/zig-cache`.
- `RULES_ZIG_CACHE_PREFIX_WINDOWS`: Cache directory on Windows, default `C:\Temp\zig-cache`.
- `RULES_ZIG_CACHE_PREFIX`: Cache directory fall-back for all platforms, default `/tmp/zig-cache`.

> [!Note]
> On Bazel 7 and above you need to explicitly allow persistence in the sandbox.
> You can use the following `.bazelrc` snippet, adjust the paths depending on
> your cache configuration.
>
> ```
> common --enable_platform_specific_config
> # You can configure `/tmp/zig-cache`, or similar, specifically,
> # if you can ensure that the directory exists before the build.
> build:linux --sandbox_add_mount_pair=/tmp
> build:macos --sandbox_add_mount_pair=/var/tmp
> build:windows --sandbox_add_mount_pair=C:\Temp
> ```
